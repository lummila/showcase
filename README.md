# Aleksi Lummila's showcase!
Showroom for projects I participated in.

## Raspberry Pi Health Device
An embedded IoT device designed to act as a heart rate monitor, local heart rate variability (HRV) analyzer and a device to wirelessly connect to Kubios Cloud for an in-depth HRV analysis.
The device was designed to work on a custom-made devboard with a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller as the central unit. The device featured a rotary encoder with a knob switch, an OLED display and a Crowtail Pulse sensor.

**My role was to implement the pulse detection algorithm and to organize the codebase hierarchy.**
